## Lab 6 : Interfaces in Practice
=====================================

## ReadMe
	- Took me an hour to do.
	- I struggled with what methods to put in an interface and what to put in my classes. In my head, and for my specific example, it helped for me to think of the interfaces as "actions" that the character could do.
	- I learned that interfaces are great for grouping together similar functionalities so that specific classes can implement them.
    - I used the class demo as a resource.
